I am Akshay Govind S, a Final-year Bachelors student majoring in Mechanical
Engineering and Minoring in AI at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM)](iitm.ac.in). I am really interested in creating impact using AI, apply AI to reduce computational times for Transport Problems (specifically Computational Fluid Dynamics) and answering fundamental questions in AI in terms of why and how it works ? I am being advised by [Prof. Prabhu Rajagopal (ME, IITM)](https://mech.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?fname=prajagopal) and [Prof. Balaji Srinivasan (WSAI, IITM)](https://wsai.iitm.ac.in/faculty/balaji-srinivasan/). I worked under the mentorship of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/)and [Dr. Gokul S Krishnan](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/people/gokul-s-krishnan/) at [Center for Responsible AI (CERAI)](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/).

**Research Interests**: Operator Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Nets, Physics informed Extreme Learning Machines, Multi-Agent RL, Continuous Flow Models and Large Language Models

[18 July 2025] Our paper "IndiCASA: A Dataset and Bias Evaluation Framework in LLMs Using Contrastive Embedding Similarity in the Indian Context" has been accepted at AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES 2025)!

[19 May 2025] I have joined Adobe Media and Data Science Research Lab as an intern working on building Multi-Agent Collaborative RL framework for Video Tasks

[06 June 2024] I have joined Sarvam.AI as an intern working on building AI agents for Multi-lingual Healthcare use case.
