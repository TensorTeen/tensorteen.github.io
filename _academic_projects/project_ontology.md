- An ongoing project under the guidance of Prof. Gandham Phanikumar, Professor, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Indian Institute of Technolgy Madras, 
- The project aims to access better insights in data by using a knowledge graph to store information
- The project aims to democratize data access by making knowlege graph accessible through Natural Language Queries
- Implemented a RDF Graph based Ontology for Material Science data
- Implemented a LangChain pipeline to convert Natural Language queries into SPARQL queries
- Currently Extending the pipeline to retrieve output automatically
- Looking forward to use open-source LLMs like Mixtral, and optimising the LLM output
