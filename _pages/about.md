I am Akshay Govind S, a Final-year Bachelors student majoring in Mechanical
Engineering and Minoring in AI at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM)](iitm.ac.in). I am really interested in creating impact using AI in the following ways: Building Robust Foundational Models for Physics, applying AI to reduce computational times for Transport Problems (specifically Computational Fluid Dynamics) and answering fundamental questions in AI in terms of why and how it works ? I am being advised by [Prof. Balaji Srinivasan (WSAI, IITM)](https://wsai.iitm.ac.in/faculty/balaji-srinivasan/) on In-Context Learning for Physics Foundational Models. I have worked under the mentorship of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/)and [Dr. Gokul S Krishnan](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/people/gokul-s-krishnan/) at [Center for Responsible AI (CERAI)](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/) in building Robust Bias Evaluation Frameworks.

**Research Interests**: Foundational Models for Physics, Operator Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Nets, Physics informed Extreme Learning Machines, Multi-Agent RL, Continuous Flow Models and Large Language Models

[22 Sep 2025] Our Paper "Deep vs. Shallow: Benchmarking Physics-Informed Neural Architectures on the Biharmonic Equation" has been accepted at Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at Neural Information Processsing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025 !

[10 Sep 2025] Our Paper "Enhancing Financial RAG with Agentic AI and Multi-HyDE: A Novel Approach to Knowledge Retrieval and Hallucination Reduction" has been accepted at FinNLP, Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2025 !

[18 July 2025] Our paper "IndiCASA: A Dataset and Bias Evaluation Framework in LLMs Using Contrastive Embedding Similarity in the Indian Context" has been accepted at AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES 2025) !

[19 May 2025] I have joined Adobe Media and Data Science Research Lab as an intern working on building Multi-Agent Collaborative RL framework for Video Tasks

[06 June 2024] I have joined Sarvam.AI as an intern working on building AI agents for Multi-lingual Healthcare use case.
